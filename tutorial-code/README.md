# Tutorial: Programming Games in C for the Vectrex

**STARTS SOON on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Gxzj2xb2M&list=PLP6u_67PQGuHlz8J7U2Y6oUv05O_74D2w)**


### Introduction
Programming the Vectrex in [6809 Assembler](http://vide.malban.de/help/vectrex-tutorial-ii) can be challenging if you have never worked with Assembler before.
But for a long time it was the only way to write performant games for the Vectrex.
With this tutorial series, I focus therefore on C to bring Game Programming for the Vectrex to a wider audience
of interested developers. By using [Classics Coder for Vectrex](http://www.classicscoder.com/classics-coder-vec.html) and the underlying [CMOC C-Compiler](https://www.github.com/rogerboesch/cmoc-classics-coder), it's easy for everyone
and really simple for C programmers coming from other platforms to create games for this unique platform.
I hope you enjoy this tutorial as I have done when creating the tools and writing this down.
But let's start now and bring you closer to the "Secrets" on **Programming Games in C for the Vectrex!**

### Installation

#### macOS
All you need to follow this tutorial is **The Classics Coder App** (macOS) which can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rogerboesch/vectrex-dev/master/tools/Classics_Coder_for_Vectrex-Latest.tar.gz).
As you can see in my [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Gxzj2xb2M&list=PLP6u_67PQGuHlz8J7U2Y6oUv05O_74D2w), it's simple to install and use.


#### Windows
*Windows support is coming soon. In the meantime you can easily install the toolchain to follow the tutorials by using the command line.
How to to this I will explain in this YouTube Video (coming soon)*


#### Linux
*Linux support is coming soon. In the meantime you can easily install the toolchain to follow the tutorials by using the command line.
How to to this I will explain in this YouTube Video (coming soon)*
