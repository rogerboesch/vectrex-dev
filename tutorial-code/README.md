# Tutorial, Programming Games in C for the Vectrex

### Introduction
Programming the Vectrex in [6809 Assembler]() can be challenging if you have never worked in Assembler before.
But for a long time it was the only way to write performant games for the Vectrex.
With this tutorial series, I focus therefore on C to bring Game Programming for the Vectrex to a wider audience
of interested developers. By using [Classics Coder for Vectrex](http://www.classicscoder.com/classics-coder-vec.html) and the underlying [CMOC C-Compiler](https://www.github.com/rogerboesch/cmoc-classics-coder), it's easy for everyone
and really simple for C programmers coming from other platforms to create games for this unique platform.
I hope you enjoy this tutorial as I have done when creating the tools and writing this down.
But let's start now and bring you closer to the "Secrets" on **Programming Games in C for the Vectrex!**
