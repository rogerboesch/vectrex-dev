# Vectrex C Development

### Introduction
This is the source and tool git repo associated with the **C-Programming tutorial for the Vectrex**
I start soon. You can either follow the tutorials by install **The Classics Coder Vectrex IDE** or by using your favored
code editor and the command line.

Classics Coder is (at the moment) mainly focused on simple examples and therefore perfect for the beginner and learner.
Also it just runs on macOS (iOS coming soon), but natively and without security restrictions on macOS (up to Big Sur)
*Note: If you search for a Vextrex IDE that supports more features for professional development take a look at [VIDE](https://github.com/malbanGit/Vide)*
